# Payment Platform (Exercise Project)

A practice PHP project where I built a **micro-framework from scratch**, including:

- HTTP routing
- Async task processing
- Email sending
- Database access
- Dependency Injection Container

**Goal:** Learn and experiment with core framework concepts by implementing them manually.

## Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` â†’ `.env` and configure DB & mail.
2. `composer install`
3. Run server / Docker setup.
4. (Optional) Run migrations & async workers.

## Play With
- Add routes & handlers
- Queue async jobs (emails, payments)
- Extend DI container
- Enhance DB layer
